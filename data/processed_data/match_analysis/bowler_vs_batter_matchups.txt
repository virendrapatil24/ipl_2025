Bowler Type vs. Batter Type analysis

1. Fast Bowlers

a. Right-arm pacers
- Most effective against left-handers with inswinging deliveries (e.g., Bumrah to Warner).
- Short-of-length deliveries work well against Indian batters, who prefer full balls.
- Slower bouncers deceive aggressive batters at the death.

b. Left-arm pacers
- More effective against right-handers, swinging the ball away early (e.g., Shaheen Afridi vs. Kohli).
- Yorkers at the death trouble most batters (e.g., Mitchell Starc, Trent Boult).

c. Express Pace (Above 145 km/h)
- Can trouble all batters with pace and bounce.
- Short balls work against Indian batters due to slower domestic pitches.


2. Spinners

a. Off-spinners (Right-arm finger spinners)
- Effective against left-handers (e.g., Ashwin vs. David Warner).
- Tend to struggle against right-handers in IPL due to aggressive sweeps and power hitting.

b. Leg-spinners (Right-arm wrist spinners)
- Highly effective against right-handers, as the ball spins away (e.g., Rashid Khan, Yuzvendra Chahal).
- Googlies trouble left-handers (e.g., Rashid Khan vs. Rishabh Pant).

c. Left-arm orthodox spinners
- Effective against right-handers by spinning the ball away (e.g., Ravindra Jadeja vs. Rohit Sharma).

d. Chinaman (Left-arm wrist spinners)
- Effective against right-handers, difficult to read (e.g., Kuldeep Yadav).
