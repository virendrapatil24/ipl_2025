Batting-Friendly Pitches
Flat Tracks (e.g., Wankhede, Chinnaswamy, Eden Gardens)

High-scoring venues where 200+ totals are common.
Fast bowlers struggle if they don’t have variations.
Spinners who rely on turn don’t get much help.
Hard-hitters like Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, and Jos Buttler thrive.
Hard & Bouncy (e.g., DY Patil, Brabourne, Pune, Mohali)

Fast bowlers can extract bounce but don’t get much swing.
Batters who handle back-of-length balls well score freely.
Spinners need extra drift to be effective.
Bowling-Friendly Pitches
Swing-Friendly (e.g., Chennai, Ahmedabad in early IPL matches)

Early swing movement favors fast bowlers (e.g., Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Trent Boult).
Powerplay wickets are common.
Batters who survive the first 3-4 overs can dominate later.
Slow & Turning Tracks (e.g., Chennai, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Delhi in later IPL stages)

Spinners dominate, especially in the second innings.
Chasing is difficult when the ball grips.
High-reward conditions for finger spinners like Jadeja and Sunil Narine.
Low Scoring & Two-Paced (e.g., Kotla, Lucknow, Chepauk in latter stages)

Slow bowlers and cutters work well.
Shot-making is difficult unless set batters are in.
Spinners control the middle overs (8-15).
